## Coming Soon with more functionality

- **Translate Transcriptions into Multiple Languages**  
  - I'm working on adding support for translating transcriptions into multiple languages using the DeepL API or any free api.  
  - To improve performance and reduce API usage, I've also implemented backend caching by storing translations in the database‚Äîso if the same text is requested again, it won't trigger a new API call. the backend is ready with the route `audioRouter.post('/:id/translate',generalLimiter,translateTranscriptionController)`

- **Export to PDF / DOCX**  
  - I plan to add functionality to export edited transcriptions as PDF or Word documents for easy sharing.

- **Searchable History & Filtering**  
  - I'm planning to enhance the history page with search and filter options so users can easily locate specific transcriptions. and also get the specific transcription edited history based on title of the transcriptions or tags.
